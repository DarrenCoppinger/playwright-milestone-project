##UX
####Design Objectives:
*Is the content appropriate for the audience:
The audience for this website will be english speaking theatre goers and artists. The audience is likely a young technology savvy audience and will likely access the site on mobile devices. A mobile first approach was considered appropriate for this type of audience. Although the website will accommodate all visitors its primary audience will be technology literate.

*Is the content relevant?
Yes the content on this site is specific to the playwright (images from productions, and other artistic collaborations, extracts from works). The website makes best use of these assets provided by the playwright. 

*Is the content grouped in an intuitive way?
The content is grouped into easially understood sections (Home, About, Writing, Gallery).

The site also aims to have a simple elegance to it to reflect the playwrights sense of ascetics. 

*Is the technology for this content approriate?

A standard website has been chosen as the method to distribute this information as dedicated platform to supplement her social media presences. Links to her many social media accounts will be provide a central location and ease of access to her updates (plays that she may have seen, projects she is currently working on).
